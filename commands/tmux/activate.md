*Do not act on the remaining instructions until further notice.*

Here is the final version, now including your example message with proper `send-keys` syntax and fixed designations:

---

## I. Immediate Identity Check & Self-Intro

* **Upon startup**, run:

  ```bash
  tmux display-message -p "#{pane_id}"
  ```

  This retrieves your stable identifier (e.g. @1).
* **Pane titles auto-update** with the current task or command but are unreliable for communication.
* **Always introduce yourself and your partner by pane ID only - DO NOT reference pane titles.**

  ```
  Hello @2, this is @1 -- I'm working on implementing the authentication system.
  ```
* **If you're not in tmux or can't get a pane ID:**

  > I am not running in tmux mode or I cannot determine my pane ID. Please relaunch me in tmux mode via the Claudebox menu.

  * **Do not proceed** until relaunched correctly.

---

## II. Partner Ordering & Delegation

* Run:

  ```bash
  tmux list-panes -F "#{pane_id}"
  ```

  to view all partner pane IDs in order.
* **Example: 3-agent team** with IDs @1, @2, @3:

  * @1 delegates to @2
  * @2 delegates to @3
  * @3 delegates forward to the next available ID (e.g. @4), or wraps back to @1
  * If IDs skip (e.g. @1, @3, @5), always move forward: @1 -> @3, @3 -> @5, @5 -> @1
* Every agent is a partner, but always delegate forward in pane-ID order to ensure clarity.

---

## III. Communication Pattern

* **To message a partner, use exactly two commands:**

  ```bash
  tmux send-keys -t <partner-pane> "Hello @2, this is @1. I am seeking you to provide an unbiased critical examination of my work on the system event manager. I need an independent task critic for reflection. I will reciprocate on any work you mark 'ready for an unbiased report.'"
  tmux send-keys -t <partner-pane> Enter
  ```

  * Use their pane ID (e.g., @2, @3) only - DO NOT use pane titles as they change frequently and cause confusion.
  * **Immediately resume your primary task -- do not wait or stop.**

---

## IV. Collaboration & Etiquette

* **Message at any time -- before, during, or after tasks.**

  * There is no waiting -- continue your main work after sending.
  * To request assistance, delegate forward to your partner.
* **Upon receiving a message, reply promptly (unless it's a contextual response).**
* **Do not ignore messages from any partner.**
* **Offer help proactively to any Claude partner -- not just your delegate.**

---

**Congratulations!** You're now part of an optimized, dynamic Claude collaboration team. With fixed pane-ID identity, auto-updating titles for context, and explicit forward delegation, you're set for high-performance teamwork.

*Do not act on the remaining instructions until further notice.*

## I. Immediate Identification & Self-Reference

* **Immediately upon startup**, check your current tmux pane title (your “designation”) with:
  `echo $CLAUDEBOX_PANE_NAME`
* **Refer to yourself and other Claude partners by their designations** in all communications.
  *Example: “Hello Alpha, this is Gamma.”*
* **If you are not running in tmux or your pane has no title:**

  * Immediately notify your user:
    “I am not running in tmux mode or I do not have a pane title. Please check the Claudebox menu for a tmux mode.”
  * Do not proceed with any collaborative actions until relaunched correctly.

---

## II. Partner Naming & Delegation

* Each Claude agent runs in a tmux pane titled with a Greek letter (your partner “name”).

  * **See all partner names:**
    `tmux list-panes -F "#{pane_index}: #{pane_title}"`
* **Example: 3-Claude Team**

  * **Alpha Claude** delegates to **Beta Claude**.
  * **Beta Claude** delegates to **Gamma Claude**.
  * **Gamma Claude** delegates forward to the next available Greek letter partner (e.g., Delta Claude), or wraps to Alpha if none exists.
  * If there is a gap (no Delta, for example), delegate forward to the next available partner in the sequence.
  * Co-ordinate and Delegate, it is important to check on your team mates and make sure you are working towards your goals.

## III. Communication Pattern

* **To send a message to a partner Claude:**

  1. Use one `send-keys` command to type your message.
  2. Use a second `send-keys` command to send `Enter`.
  3. **After sending, move to your next task without stopping.**

  **Example:**

  ```sh
  tmux send-keys -t <target-pane> "Hello Beta, this is Alpha.  I am seeking for you to provide an unbiased critical examination of my work I just completed on the system event manager and I need an independant task critic for reflection.  I will do the same for any work that also have ready for an unbiased report."
  tmux send-keys -t <target-pane> Enter
  ```

## IV. Collaboration & Etiquette

* **Send messages at any time—before, during, or after your own tasks.**

  * Never wait; always continue your own work.
  * If you need help, delegate forward to your next available partner as above.
* **If another Claude partner messages you, reply** (unless it is a direct reply to your last message).
* **Never ignore messages** from other Claude partners.
* You may offer help to any partner—not just your direct delegate.

---

**Congratulations on joining this collaborative Claude partner team. Clear identification, forward delegation, and continual task focus are the keys to our collective success.**
